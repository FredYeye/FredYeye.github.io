            <p class="date">2025-03-22</p>
            <p><i>Note: I wasn't the one who discovered this. <a href="https://www.thesupersnes.tv/casual/7thsaga/7th-saga-seed-manipulation/">Kirkq and Nitrodon</a> gets the credit for that.</i></p>
            <p>Today we're going to try figuring out just where in a PRNG sequence we might be at so we can predict upcoming RNG rolls. More specifically we'll be analyzing the <span class="explanation" title="multiplicative congruential generator">MCG</span>, also known as the Lehmer RNG, as it's being used in The 7th Saga.</p>
            <img src="img/article6/1.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:585; height:448;">
            <h3>The motive</h3>
            <p>Every once in a while you'll find various seeds that increase your stats permanently. While this is great, the big hitch here is that the stat increase is a random value between 1-4! You need all the stats you can get when speedrunning this game (or even just playing casually!), so getting those +4 increases is vital.<br>If we knew the upcoming RNG values we could predict when a seed will give a +4.</p>
            <p>Before we get into the method, let's quickly go over some important facts about the MCG, which is responsible for handing out random numbers whenever they're needed.</p>
            <h3>MCG 101</h3>
            <p>The way the MCG works is simple: whenever a new value is requested, first multiply the rng state variable with some constant and then return the state:</p>
            <pre>rng_state = rng_state * multiplier;</pre>
            <p>When the <i>modulus</i> of an MCG is a power of two, the <span class="explanation" title="Number of updates / rolls until the sequence repeats">period</span> will be at most a quarter of the modulus. In the case of The 7th Saga, the rng state variable is 16 bits. Any result bigger than that gets clipped off, so the modulus is 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536 which gives us a maximum period of 65536 / 4 = 16384.</p>
            <p>At this point, you are probably not wondering... which of these 65536 values are we not reaching? Well, let me tell you anyway!</p>
            <p>To achieve this maximum period of modulus / 4, the state and multiplier must be odd. This rules out all even numbers, which cuts away 2/4 of the possible values. Additionally, only half of all the odd values are reachable from any given starting state. This removes another 1/4 from the total values. Thus we're left with 1/4 of the 65536 potential values, that is 16384.</p>
            <p>One last important fact: similar to the <span class="explanation" title="Linear congruential generator">LCG</span>, the higher the bit, the longer the period for that bit before it starts repeating its sequence:</p>
            <pre>Bit # | Period
    0 |      1 (always 1)
    1 |      2 (flips between 0 and 1)
    2 |      2 (flips between 0 and 1)
    3 |      4
    4 |      8
    5 |     16
    6 |     32
    7 |     64
    8 |    128
    9 |    256
   10 |    512
   11 |   1024
   12 |   2048
   13 |   4096
   14 |   8192
   15 |  16384
   ...</pre>
            <p>For example, let's say you request a new random value over and over and only keep bits 0-4. This would yield repeat sequences after a measly 8 requests, and the lower bits repeat even more often than that. Including bit 0 would be especially unwise, since it's always 1!<br>Games with a 16 bit MCG (or LCG) commonly discard bits 0-7 and returns bits 8-15 for this reason. The 7th Saga is no exception, returning bits 8-15.</p>
            <p>With that, let's move on to the main part.</p>
            <h3>The method</h3>
            <p>Alright, so we want to guarantee a +4 stat increase from seeds. When using a seed, the game pulls a random number and caps it to 0-3 by discarding all bits except the two lowest bits (that's bits 8-9 from the rng state) and adds 1 for a range of 1-4:</p>
            <pre>stat_increase = (random_value & 0b11) + 1;</pre>
            <p>To always get a +4 we need to know where we are in the RNG sequence so that the next value we get is a 3. To do that, we need some way to observe the RNG. Fortunately, someone realized that NPCs choose a walking direction by also getting a random value!</p>
            <img src="img/article6/2.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:585; height:448;">
            <p class="img_note">An alien taking notes of the movements of an unsuspecting church-goer.</p>
            <p>It works much the same way - get a random number, cap it to 0-3. Each number maps to a direction to walk towards:</p>
            <pre>0: Up
1: Down
2: Left
3: Right</pre>
            <p>This means that if we use a seed when an NPC is about to walk to the right, the next random number is a 3.<br>By observing the movements of an NPC, we can "see" bits 8-9 by the way it's moving. Believe it or not - this is actually enough information for us to use!</p>
            <p>The highest bit being used determines the period as mentioned in the MCG section, so bits 8-9 will have a period of 256 - NPC movement and seed stats are both moving along the same repeating 256-step sequence.</p>
            <p>To find out where we are in this sequence, we'll observe a lone NPC's movement and write down its walk directions. Once we've gathered a few directions, we'll convert them to a list of corresponding values (0-3) and see how many instances of this list exists within the 256-step sequence. If we get more matches than just one, we need to gather more directions to ascertain where we are.<br>Given enough directions we'll eventually get down to one match... huh...</p>
            <p>No matches... what do you mean, <i>no matches</i>?!</p>
            <h3>...But first, we need to talk about parallel streams</h3>
            <p>So we generated a list of 256 values from the MCG and compared a direction list against it, and there's no match! How can that be? The NPC is simply following the RNG!</p>
            <p>Recall back to the MCG 101 section. We're getting 1/4 values out of the possible 65536 values a 16 bit variable can hold. All even numbers are out of the question, which still rules out 2/4, but... what about that other 1/4, those other unreachable odd numbers...?</p>
            <p>Indeed, The 7th Saga doesn't have a fixed starting state! It's at least in part based on some frame counter, so the RNG really could be starting on any value.<br>To avoid the state being even, the state is always made odd by adding 1 if it's even when requesting a value.</p>
            <p>We didn't get a match earlier because we were only checking one set of reachable odd numbers, while the game was using the <i>other</i> set of odd numbers!</p>
            <p>All we have to do is to generate two 256-step sequences based on both sets of reachable odd numbers. Then we once again compare a step list against these two until only one match is found... and <i>now</i> we've found out where in the RNG sequence we are! When the NPC's next step would be to the right (3), we cut in and use our stat seed.</p>
