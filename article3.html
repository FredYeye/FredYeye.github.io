        <h1 class="post_title">Mercenary Kings: editing save data</h1>
        <p class="date">2022-11-24</p>
        <p>I've been playing through <i>Mercenary Kings</i> recently and while fun, the last few <i>cheevos</i> requires you to find a lot of materials for crafting.<br>To speed up the process I went to check if i could edit the save file and add lots of materials, as you do.</p>
        <p>I opened up the save file in a hex editor and couldn't really make out any of the data in it. I gathered some material and compared the old save file with the new file... it looked like a completely different garbled mess! Did they encrypt the save files?!</p>
        <p>Instead of accepting loss and farming materials, I decided to try to decompile the game for leads on how to decrypt the save files, naturally.</p>
        <h3>Finding the right tool for the job!</h3>
        <p>My first approach was to open the game executable in <i>Ghidra</i>, a reverse engineering tool, and it got stuck on loading the file.<br>A quick google search for the error message I received revealed that Ghidra was not the right tool for this job - I had a <i>.NET executable</i> on my hands!<br>I might get back to Ghidra in a later article, but for now we have to look for another tool.</p>
        <p>My knowledge of XNA / .NET / C# is not so good, so excuse me for any mixed up terminology I might use, haha. In any case, what I wanted was in fact a <i>.NET decompiler</i>, so I downloaded and ran <i>dotPeek</i>. I didn't really know what the output would look like, but I figured it might be easier to read than whatever Ghidra produces and...</p>

        <p class="img_note">Well! What is it?</p>
        <p>...and... everything is just... <i>there!</i> All the code of the game: functions, variables, all the bells and whistles, it's all there with original names and everything. Suddenly this venture, which seemed somewhat futile, felt incredibly <i>doable</i>.</p>
        <p>In just a matter of minutes I found the save encrypt/decrypt functions. I quickly whipped up a small C# program to accept a file to encrypt or decrypt. I could nearly use the game functions as-is; the only real change I had to make was to set the padding mode of the encryption to none. Could the default padding mode have changed since the game was released, perhaps?</p>

        <p class="img_note">Decrypted data.</p>
        <p>From there it was just a matter of mapping out what data was where in the file. Once again, having the source code for the save file writer made this a much simpler process. I found the item order in <i>ItemType.cs</i>, which has all the item types in a list.</p>
        <p>As an example, let's add some extra <i>Adamantite</i>.</p>
        <img src="img/article3/itemlist.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:477; height:578;">
        <p class="img_note">ItemType.cs</p>
        <p>So... Adamantite is item 14. Each item is 6 bytes long and, in my case, the item list started at byte 140. 140 + 14 * 6 = 224, or 0xE0 in hex.</p>

        <p class="img_note">Let's just add a liiittle bit extra...</p>
        <p>Fire up the game and...</p>
        <img src="img/article3/inventory.png" alt="" class="center" style="width:812; height:732;">
        <p>...tadah! You can even give yourself other kinds of items like gun parts, knives and ornaments to name a few. Lots of money and materials will do for me, though!</p>
