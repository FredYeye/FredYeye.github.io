        <p>Randomness in games is an important part of making every playthrough different and keeping the player on their toes. But where does it come from? Let's take a look at some algorithms games employ to create randomness.</p>
        <p>I will say up-front that I am in no way an expert on randomness, I have just stumbled upon the subject many times while researching games for speedrun and TAS purposes. With that out of the way, let's get to it!</p>
        <h3>PRNG</h3>
        <p>These generators are <i>Pseudo-Random Number Generators</i>, or PRNGs for short. What this means is that they are deterministic; they are not <i>truly</i> random. The PRNG state will be self-contained most of the time, but it's also not an uncommon practice to to mix in non-deterministic data to attempt to randomize the state more. Such data might be player input, modifying the state in different ways on value requests, using leftover results from other functions to alter the state, etc...</p>
        <h3>Quality of randomness</h3>
        <p>There are many ways to test the quality of PRNGs with tools such as DieHarder, TestU01, PractRand and the Hamming-weight dependecy test. We're not going to go so deep (further explanation why below) and just run our generators through PractRand. Why PractRand specifically? It's easy to use and prints out a fun number of tests passed for us to look at.</p>
        <!-- <h3>So... how much does this matter?</h3> -->
        <p>So... have you ever played Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts and thought to yourself that the monsters seem to do the same thing over and over again? No?<br>If I didn't tell you that the PRNG used in Goof Troop is broken, would you ever have known?</p>
        <p>Almost all of these generators are going to fare badly in these test suites - they simply weren't made for applications like scientific simulations or cryptography. In many cases it was simply not possible to spend more processing power on randomness because the rest of the game had to run as well, all within a 60th of a second.</p>
        <p>Most of the time we're just deciding if a monster should go this way or that way, or what items a chest  should contain. Having a high quality source of randomness is of course great, but as long as the source is decent enough and used in clever ways you'd never know the randomness is of "low quality".</p>
        <h3>Randograms</h3>
        <p>The images below are made by generating pairs of random numbers from the PRNG in question, and using them as coordinates into a black image. The brightness is then increased at the selected coordinate. The images aren't really indicative of randomness quality, but we can still look at them and see if they look about right or if they have clear (non-random looking) patterns.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <p>This method has four state variables that are increased at their own rate every frame. When requesting a value, it cycles to the next state variable and adds a constant to it.</p>
        <p>The carry flag, which is used for the ADC operation, is set differently every time the Frame_update() function is called. This plus the added request constant makes this generator non-deterministic.</p>
        <p>This image was generated by always setting the carry flag to false and simulating one PRNG request per frame.</p>

        <div class="content">
        <p>This one shares some similarity with their earlier arcade PRNG (and to Quintet's PRNG). A LFSR-style shift is performed on the first element, followed by a series of adds throughout the state (while adding in a unique constant per element).</p>
        <p>As far as I can tell, every function that needs randomness has a hardcoded slot it picks a number from, and then adds a constant back to that slot. It's different for every function so it's possible that there are functions that do other types of scrambling, akin to Mega Man 5 for example (change other slots, combine slot values, etc).</p>
        <p>Since this PRNG has unpredictable updates, the image and the PractRand result do not reflect the actual usage so well. The image was generated by calling <i>update_state()</i> and getting the lower byte of rng_state[7] (no constants added on getting the value). There are two PractRand results: one for the lower byte of rng_state[7] (more likely what the game would use) and one for the upper byte (less likely to be used by the game, but should score better in tests).</p>

        <div class="content">
        <p>As consoles and the tools around them advanced, the need to write everything from scratch decreased. Most games around the PS1 / N64 era were likely written in C for example, which typically gave you access to some form of the <i>C standard library:</i> pre-written general purpose code so you didn't have to write it yourself. And yes, there's a rand() function in there!</p>
        <p>While rand() can be implemented in different ways as long as it fills some certain criterias, I think it's fair to say that most implementations, especially at that time were all the same: a LCG with a 2<sup>31</sup> period. The return value is the upper half of the state (minus the sign bit to stop careless devs from making mistakes, I'm sure), as the quality of the lower bits of a LCG are typically very poor.<br>By today's standards it would probably not seem so good, but compared to most earlier PRNGs we've seen it is pretty darn good!</p>
        <p>As this was (is?) the standard rand() function in most C libraries, this PRNG has probably been used many, many times in countless games.</p>
