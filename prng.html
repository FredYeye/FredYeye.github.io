        <p>Randomness in games is an important part of making every playthrough different and keeping the player on their toes. But where does it come from? Here we'll look at some algorithms games employ to create randomness.</p>
        <p>I will say up-front that I am in no way an expert on randomness, I have just stumbled upon the subject many times while researching games for speedrun and TAS purposes. With that out of the way, let's get to it!</p>
        <p>The below images are made by generating a pair of random numbers from the PRNG in question, and using them as coordinates into a black image. The brightness is then increased at the selected coordinate, until a pixel that is max white would get hit again. The images aren't super scientific and don't necessarily match what actually happens in-game. Still, they give us some idea of what's going on.</p>

        <h3 class="prng">Using the frame counter (Capcom)</h3>
        <p>This method has four state variables that are increased in different multiples of the frame counter, and cycles between them on every PRNG request. In addition, the PRNG request also updates the state with it's own constant.<br>It should be noted that the carry flag which is used for the ADC operation is set differently every time the Frame_update() function is called, making the state update less predictable.<br>This one is hard to fairly represent in an image - this image was generated by simulating two PRNG requests per frame (which is way more frequent than what would ever happen in the actual game).</p>
        <pre style="min-height:256px;"><img src="img/prng/ff.png" alt="" class="prng">u16 frame_counter = 0

{
    slot = (slot + 1) & 3 <span>//increment slot and limit to 0-3</span>
    ADC(rng_state[slot], 0x13)

        <p>Many early Capcom games on the snes started out with a LCG random number generator with m=2<sup>16</sup>, c=0. This setup (c=0) is also known as a Lehmer RNG.<br>Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Notice the uniform diagonal patterns in the generated image.</p>

        <h3 class="prng">Capcom's broken PRNG!</h3>
        <p>At some point, Capcom decided to switch up their PRNG algorithm, but something clearly went wrong here! The algorithm itself is fine - it's actually an improvement over their previous LCG. They just used the wrong half of the rng state as a return value!<p>

        <p>Quintet employed a quite sophisticated PRNG for the time - the Add-with-carry algorithm. While requiring a bigger state and more execution time to update, the difference certainly shows up on the generated image. Note the black diagonal line: this is due to the zero state prevention that always runs when the PRNG is called.</p>

        <p>This appears to be a (Fibonacci) Linear-Feedback Shift Register, or LFSR for short. The taps are bits 57 and 49; bit 0 is not a tap, oddly enough. The period (the amount of updates until the initial state is reached again) is a measly 32767, which could be achieved with a quarter of the bits used and some better chosen taps.</p>
