        <p>Randomness in games is an important part of making every playthrough different and keeping the player on their toes. But where does it come from? Here we'll look at some algorithms games employ to create randomness.</p>
        <p>I will say up-front that I am in no way an expert on randomness, I have just stumbled upon the subject many times while researching games for speedrun and TAS purposes. With that out of the way, let's get to it!</p>
        <p>The below images are made by generating a pair of random numbers from the PRNG in question, and using them as coordinates into a black image. The brightness is then increased at the selected coordinate, until a pixel that is max white would get hit again.</p>
        <h3 class="prng">Capcom's early PRNG on the SNES</h3>
        <p>Capcom games on the snes started out with a LCG random number generator with m=2<sup>16</sup>, c=0.<br>Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Notice the uniform diagonal patterns in the generated image.</p>

    rng_state *= 259
    return rng_state >> 8

        <ul>
        <li>Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts (1991-10-04)<p style="font-style:italic;">Notes:<br>Called on demand only.<br>Used heavily in stage 1, which will "seed" the state.</p></li>
        <li>The Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse (1992-11-20)<p style="font-style:italic;">Notes:<br>Called on demand only.<br>No attempts at seeding the state.<br>Resets the state at every new stage.</p></li>
        <li>Aladdin (1993-11-21)<p style="font-style:italic;">Notes:<br>Called on demand only.<br>Frequent prng usage early to "seed" the state.<br>Dying resets the state.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="prng">Another LCG from Capcom</h3>
        <p>This time we have an LCG with m=2<sup>16</sup>, c=15329.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="prng">Capcom's broken PRNG!</h3>
        <p>At some point, Capcom decided to switch up their PRNG algorithm, but something clearly went wrong here! The algorithm itself is fine - it's actually an improvement over their previous LCG. They just used the wrong half of the rng state!<p>

    rng_state = x | u8((x >> 8) + rng_state)

        <h3 class="prng">Capcom's fixed PRNG</h3>
        <p>Luckily Capcom realized something wasn't quite right and fixed the return value issue. The initial state was also updated. The generated image has much less apparent symmetry compared to the earlier LCG.</p>

        <h3 class="prng">Quintet's state-of-the-art PRNG</h3>
        <p>Quintet employed a quite sophisticated PRNG for the time - the Add-with-carry algorithm. While requiring a bigger state and more execution time to update, the difference certainly shows up on the generated image. Note the black diagonal line: this is due to the zero state prevention that always runs when the PRNG is called.</p>
