        <h3>Fishin' for the big Lunkers</h3>
        <p>Catching the big fish and beating Mark Davis at his own game is no easy task! There are many factors deciding the outcome of your fishing adventures. We'll go over some of the important ones here.</p>
        <p>An important factor in reeling in the the big ones is your <i>fishing rating</i>, which is a based on the current fishing spot and the equipped lure/bait, so let's take a look at that.</p>
        <h3>Lure / bait rating</h3>
        <p>The lure/bait rating is calculated differently depending on which lure is used:</p>
        <p>The <i>crank, minnow & topwater</i> lures simply set the rating to the equipped lure's rating, no bait can be attached.</p>
        <p>The <i>rig</i> lure adds the lure & bait ratings together.</p>
        <p>For the <i>buzz, spinner & rubber</i> lures it again starts out with the lure rating. One point is added if any bait is attached; it does not use the bait ratings. Some lures will deduct points if no bait is attached: the rubber lures will remove one point, and the four last colorado spinners will zero out the rating entirely.</p>
