        <p>Upon starting a new tournament run, Mark Davis and nine other competitors (out of 16 possible) are chosen to challenge you.</p>
        <p>When you weigh in, the game will generate their catch. The amount they catch per day depends on the stage of the tournament.</p>
        <pre>Spring       | 16.50, 16.08, 15.06, 14.82, 14.64, 13.62, 12.00, 11.58, 11.01, 10.29
Summer       | 15.00, 14.64, 14.19, 13.62, 12.84, 12.42, 11.40, 10.98, 10.44, 09.66
Fall         | 18.00, 17.58, 16.56, 15.72, 14.04, 13.32, 12.30, 09.78, 10.14, 09.24
Winter 1     | 12.96, 12.18, 10.56, 09.72, 08.04, 07.32, 06.30, 03.78, 03.24, 04.14
Winter 2     | 12.00, 11.64, 10.68, 09.72, 08.64, 07.92, 06.90, 05.64, 05.22, 04.89
Championship | 16.50, 16.08, 15.06, 14.82, 14.64, 13.62, 12.00, 11.58, 11.01, 10.29</pre>
        <p>There are ten weights per stage as seen above, one for each competitor. The game also keeps a list of competitors #1 - #10. A competitor between #1-#8 will be chosen at random and get the first fish from the list, the next in line will get the second fish and so on (wrapping around from competitor #10 to #1 if necessary).</p>
        <p>Here's an example of what it could look like:</p>
        <pre>Stage: Spring
Chosen starting competitor: #5

Competitor | Weight
-----------|-------
 1 (M.D.)  | 12.00
 2         | 11.58
 3         | 11.01
 4         | 10.29 last assignment, the smallest catch of the day! (most of the time)
 5         | 16.50 first assignment, the lunker of the day!
 6         | 16.08
 7         | 15.06
 8         | 14.82
 9         | 14.64                       \ these two poor guys cannot get the lunker!
10         | 13.62 wraps from here to #1 /</pre>
        <p>After all the weights have been assigned, 0.01 - 0.32 lbs is randomly added to each weight.<br>With that, we can calculate what kind of catches we can expect from the opposition!<br>The <i>avg</i> column is not a true average; it is the average of possible winning catches. Get a higher weight than this and you're likely to win!</p>
        <pre>Stage                 |  min  |  max  |  avg  |
----------------------|-------|-------|-------|
Spring       (1 day)  | 10.30 | 16.82 | 16.66 |
Summer       (2 days) | 19.34 | 30.64 | 29.03 |
Fall         (2 days) | 18.50 | 36.64 | 34.19 |
Winter 1     (3 days) | 12.45 | 39.84 | 33.31 |
Winter 2     (3 days) | 14.70 | 36.96 | 32.27 |
